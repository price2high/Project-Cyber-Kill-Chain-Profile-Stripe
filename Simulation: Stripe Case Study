#Cyber Kill Chain Simulation: Stripe Case Study

## Introduction
Stripe, a leading online payment processing platform, is a prime target for cyberattacks due to its vast repository of financial transactions, personal user data, and API integrations with businesses worldwide. This case study simulates a cyberattack against Stripe using the **Cyber Kill Chain** framework, a model developed by Lockheed Martin to identify and counteract cyber threats.

## Phase 1: Reconnaissance
**Objective:** Gather intelligence about Stripe’s infrastructure, technology stack, and potential vulnerabilities.

**Simulated Attack:**
- The attacker scours public sources (OSINT) such as LinkedIn, GitHub, and company job postings to identify employees, technologies in use (e.g., AWS, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL), and API documentation.
- They use passive DNS analysis and subdomain enumeration to map out Stripe’s online assets.
- Automated scanning tools detect outdated libraries used in Stripe’s frontend applications.

**Defense Measures:**
- Regular security awareness training to prevent employees from oversharing information.
- Implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict domain exposure.
- Continuous monitoring for unauthorized scanning activities.

## Phase 2: Weaponization
**Objective:** Develop an exploit that can compromise Stripe’s systems.

**Simulated Attack:**
- The attacker identifies a vulnerable third-party JavaScript library used by Stripe’s checkout flow.
- They craft a malicious payload leveraging a known Remote Code Execution (RCE) exploit.
- The payload is embedded in a phishing email disguised as a Stripe system update for merchants.

**Defense Measures:**
- Ensuring strict dependency management with automated security patching.
- Using Web Application Firewalls (WAF) to block malicious payloads.
- Educating users to recognize phishing attempts.

## Phase 3: Delivery
**Objective:** Deliver the malicious payload to Stripe’s environment.

**Simulated Attack:**
- The attacker sends phishing emails to Stripe’s customer support team containing an embedded malicious link.
- A compromised merchant’s website injects a malicious script into the Stripe API integration.
- The attacker uploads a trojanized npm package, hoping a Stripe developer unknowingly installs it.

**Defense Measures:**
- Implementing DMARC, DKIM, and SPF email security policies.
- Sandboxing and scanning all inbound emails for malware.
- Enforcing stringent npm package auditing policies.

## Phase 4: Exploitation
**Objective:** Execute the exploit and gain initial access.

**Simulated Attack:**
- A customer support agent clicks on a malicious link, triggering an XSS attack that ex
