# Project-Cyber-Kill-Chain-Profile-Stripe
# Stripe Cyber Kill Chain Simulation

Welcome to a simulation case study applying the Cyber Kill Chain framework to Stripe, a global payment processing platform. This repository is part of my cybersecurity learning journey, where I document threats, mitigation strategies, and visual tools for learning.

## 🔍 Contents

- [`stripe-kill-chain-case-study.md`](./stripe-kill-chain-case-study.md): Detailed walkthrough of a simulated cyberattack using the Cyber Kill Chain framework.
- [`images/stripe-kill-chain-visual.png`](./images/stripe-kill-chain-visual.png): Visual representation of the cyber kill chain and Stripe’s cyber profile.
- Future updates: Threat modeling, incident response playbooks, and simulations for other companies.

## 🧠 Why This Case Study?

This project is part of my "Creating a Cyborg" cybersecurity diary. It helps me understand how real-world companies defend against evolving cyber threats and apply theoretical models like the Cyber Kill Chain in a practical way.
